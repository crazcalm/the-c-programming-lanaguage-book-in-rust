# the-c-programming-lanaguage-book-in-rust

I'm done with this project. I finished reading the book and realized something that I should have already known; There is no magic in C. It is a regular programming language where people do regular things.

The only thing irregular about C are the people that used it back in the day. Those people were amazing programmers that had such a deep understanding of the fundamentals of programming (and of how computers work) that of course they were about to build amazing things.

Side note:
I will fully acknowldge that C's pointers make it an amazaingly powerful language, but, without a deep understanding of the language itself and a solid understanding of programming in general, pointer will not help you build anything.
